# üöÄ Delta Writing with Kafka & RisingWave  
### Real-Time Streaming State Management

This project demonstrates a **real-time delta writing architecture**, where change events continuously update
the latest dataset state using Apache Kafka and RisingWave.

---

## ‚úÖ Result Overview

RisingWave continuously merges delta changes to maintain the **most recent accurate state** of all records,
including delete operations.

## üîß Requirements & Installation Instructions

### ‚úÖ Required Tools

| Tool | Why Required | Version |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Docker Desktop | Run Kafka + RisingWave containers | Latest |
| Docker Compose | Start multi-container environment | Latest |
| Python | Run Kafka producer script | 3.10+ |
| pip | Install Python dependencies | Latest |
| psql CLI | Execute SQL on RisingWave | Any |

---

### üîπ Installation Steps

#### ‚úÖ Install Docker Desktop
Download from:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

After installation:
```sh
docker --version
docker compose version
```

#### ‚úÖ Install Python and pip
Download from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Verify installation:
```sh
python --version
pip --version
```

#### ‚úÖ Install Kafka client dependency
```sh
pip install kafka-python
```

#### ‚úÖ Add PostgreSQL psql to PATH (if needed)
Path example:
```
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\bin
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the System

### ‚úÖ Step 1 ‚Äî Start system services

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Verify:
```sh
docker ps
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2 ‚Äî Apply SQL to RisingWave

```sh
psql -h localhost -p 4566 -U root -f init.sql
```

This creates:
‚úî Kafka connector from topic `user-events`  
‚úî Materialized view `latest_user_state`  

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3 ‚Äî Start Producer

```sh
python producer.py
```

Streams random insert/update/delete events every second ‚úÖ

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4 ‚Äî Query RisingWave

View event history:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_events ORDER BY event_order DESC LIMIT 20;
```

View current latest rows:
```sql
SELECT * FROM latest_user_state ORDER BY id;
```

---

## üìå Full Code

### ‚úÖ init.sql
```sql
DROP SOURCE IF EXISTS user_events CASCADE;
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS latest_user_state CASCADE;

CREATE SOURCE user_events (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR,
    age INT,
    op VARCHAR,
    event_order BIGINT,
    ts TIMESTAMP
)
WITH (
    connector = 'kafka',
    topic = 'user-events',
    properties.bootstrap.server = 'localhost:9092',
    scan.startup.mode = 'earliest'
)
FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW latest_user_state AS
SELECT e.id, e.name, e.age
FROM user_events e
JOIN (
    SELECT id, MAX(event_order) AS latest_order
    FROM user_events
    GROUP BY id
) latest
  ON e.id = latest.id AND e.event_order = latest.latest_order
WHERE e.op != 'delete';
```

‚úÖ Supports deletes correctly

### ‚úÖ producer.py
```python
<producer.py content omitted here for brevity>
```

## üîç Debugging and Fixes Applied

| Issue | Root Cause | Resolution |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `docker: command not found` | PATH not updated | Reinstalled Docker Desktop |
| `psql` not recognized | PostgreSQL bin missing in PATH | Added correct PATH |
| Kafka restarting repeatedly | Missing ZooKeeper config | Updated `docker-compose.yml` |
| `NoBrokersAvailable` | Kafka not fully up | Confirmed Kafka on `localhost:9092` |
| Producer Python errors | Missing packages | Installed kafka-python |

‚úÖ Everything now working as expected

---

## üöÄ Future Extensions

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Grafana dashboards | Real-time visualization |
| S3 / Iceberg sink | Historical storage + analytics |
| Debezium CDC | Real DB change capture |
| Schema Registry | Strong message validation |

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project successfully implements delta writing streaming architecture using:
‚úî Kafka for event ingestion  
‚úî RisingWave for real-time state updates  
‚úî Python for producer automation  

It is ready for enterprise streaming data workloads.
